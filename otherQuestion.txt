--sql profiler vs extended events
	http://logicalread.solarwinds.com/why-use-sql-server-extended-events-w01/

	ee
	Microsoft has measured just how lightweight the events architecture that Extended Events use actually is, 
	and determined that 20,000 events per second firing on a server with a 2 GHz Pentium CPU and 1GB of memory
	consumed less than 2% of the CPU’s 

	like other new SQL Server features that were embedded in SQL Server Management Studio
	
	Troubleshooting blocking and deadlocking
	Finding long-running queries
	Tracking DDL operations
	Logging missing column statistics

	After you start to explore some of the more advanced capabilities of Extended Events, you’ll see it’s just as easy to track events such as the following:

	Long-running physical I/O operations
	Statements that cause specific wait stats to occur
	SQL Server memory pressure
	AlwaysOn Availability Groups events

--assemblies in asp.net

	When you compile an application, the MSIL code created is stored in an assembly . 
	Assemblies include both executable application files that you can run directly from Windows 
	without the need for any other programs (these have a .exe file extension), and libraries (which have a .dll extension)
	for use by other applications.

	Assembly is the smallest unit of deployment of a .net application. It can be a dll or an exe.
	There are mainly two types to it:

	Private Assembly: The dll or exe which is sole property of one application only. It is generally stored in application root folder

	Public/Shared assembly: It is a dll which can be used by multiple applications at a time. A shared assembly is stored in GAC i.e Global Assembly Cache.

	Sounds difficult? Naa....
	GAC is simply C:\Windows\Assembly folder where you can find the public assemblies/dlls of all the softwares installed in your PC.--get numbers of users session in iis

	http://www.dotnet-tricks.com/Tutorial/sqlserver2012/W4b4021012-SQL-Server-2012-New-Features-and-Programmability-Enhancements.html

	New Conversion Functions
	SQL Serve 2012 has support for new conversion functions TRY_CONVERT, and TRY_PARSE for convering numeric, date, and time values to desired format.
	These functions are very helpful while programming T-SQL.

	T-SQL built-in pagination
	SQL Server 2012 also supports built-in pagination with the help of OFFSET and FETCH like MySQL
		--Suppose Employee tables has 500 records
		--Below query skip 200 rows and fetch the next 20 records
		SELECT EmpID, EmpName, Salary FROM dbo.Employee
		ORDER BY EmpID
		OFFSET 200 ROWS
		FETCH NEXT 20 ROWS ONLY 

	Create Sequence object
		 --Create Sequence object
		CREATE SEQUENCE objSequence
		START WITH 1
		INCREMENT BY 1;
		 --Create Employee object
		DECLARE @Employee TABLE
		(
		ID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
		FullName nvarchar(100) NOT NULL
		)
		 --Insert values
		INSERT @Employee (ID, FullName)
		VALUES (NEXT VALUE FOR objSequence, 'Mohan'),
		(NEXT VALUE FOR objSequence, 'Deepak'),
		(NEXT VALUE FOR objSequence, 'Pavan');
 		--Show data
		SELECT * FROM @Employee

	5 Sparse Column
		http://sqlhints.com/2011/11/12/sparse-columns-in-sql-server-2008/
		Sparse Column is one more new feature introduced in SQL SERVER 2008. 
		Storing a null value in a sparse column doesn’t take any space, 
		but storing a non-null value in sparse column takes 4 bytes extra space than the non-sparse columns of the same data type.

--excutions plan
	An execution plan is composed of primitive operations. Examples of primitive operations are: 
	reading a table completely, using an index, performing a nested loop or a hash join,... 	
	
	The component of the database server that is responsible for computing the optimal execution plan is called the optimizer. 
	The optimizer bases its decision on its knowledge of the database content.

	Query Execution Plan : the query compilation process happens in three phases; Parsing, Binding and Optimization.

		Parsing, is a process to check the syntax
		Binding, is a process done by algebrizer. It checks weather query semantics are correct or not; 
			 for example, whether the specified two tables joined in the FROM clause are really tables or not
		Optimization,  attempts to determine the most efficient way to execute a given query. 
				The optimizer always tries to find the way to process/execute a query in the minimum amount of time; 
				it compares several options, with putting all possible permutations and combinations

	store procedure reused excution plan which are cache and thus process fast

--sql views
	Views are logical table or say virtual tables that are compiled at run time. 
	The data associated with views are not physically stored in the view, but it is stored in the base tables of the view. 

	In Sql Server we make views for security purpose since it restricts the user to view some columns/fields of the table(s). 

	ex
		 CREATE VIEW view_name
		 AS
 		 select_statement[] 

	type of view
			
		System Defined Views
			System defined Views are predefined Views that already exist in the Master database of Sql Server. 
			select * from sys.tables 

		User Defined Views
			view on single table or multiple table

SQLServer:
	dirty reads
		http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=721
		Quite often in database processing, we come across the situation wherein one transaction can change a value, and a second transaction can 			
		read this value before the original change has been committed or rolled back
		
		 
			http://sqlwithmanoj.com/2013/10/04/difference-between-nolock-and-readpast-table-hints/
			No shared locks are issued to prevent other transactions from modifying data read by the current transaction, 
			and exclusive locks set by other transactions do not block the current transaction from reading the locked data. 
			NOLOCK is equivalent to READUNCOMMITTED.
			
			read a record that was not yet committed
			Specifies that dirty reads are allowed

		READPAST
			the record I am updating is locked, it is ignored by the READPAST 
			ignored a record that was not yet committed
			http://sqldbpool.com/2013/10/16/table-hints-nolock-vs-readpast/		

	nocount
		what is its use : 
		SET NOCOUNT ON.  This one line of code, put at the top of a stored procedure turns off the messages that SQL Server sends back 			
	to the client after each T-SQL statement is executed.  This is performed for all SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Having		
this information is handy when you run a T-SQL statement in a query window, but when stored procedures are run there is no need for this		
information to be passed back to the client.


	type of temp table and it scope
		1. http://databases.aspfaq.com/database/should-i-use-a-temp-table-or-a-table-variable.html
		2. (nyc) http://www.dotnet-tricks.com/Tutorial/sqlserver/X517150913-Difference-between-CTE-and-Temp-Table-and-Table-Variable.html
		3. http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2009/12/28/sql-server-difference-temp-table-and-table-variable-effect-of-transaction/

	Temp Table or Table variable or CTE are commonly used for storing data temporarily in SQL Server.
	
	CtE Common Table expressions:

		Cannot have constraints(primarykey, identity)	
		Persist only until the next query is run	

		It was introduced with SQL Server 2005. It is a temporary result set and typically it may be a result of complex sub-query. 
		Unlike temporary table its life is limited to the current query. It is defined by using WITH statement.

		This is used to store result of a complex sub query for further use.
		This is also used to create a recursive query.

		;With CTE1(Address, Name, Age)--Column names for CTE, which are optional
		AS
		(
		SELECT Addr.Address, Emp.Name, Emp.Age from Address Addr
		INNER JOIN EMP Emp ON Emp.EID = Addr.EID
		)
		SELECT * FROM CTE1 --Using CTE 
		WHERE CTE1.Age > 50
		ORDER BY CTE1.NAME

		
	
	Temporary Tables
		Local Temp Table

			Local temp tables are only available to the SQL Server session or connection (means single user) that created the tables. 
			These are automatically deleted when the session that created the tables has been closed. Local 

			temporary table name is stared with single hash ("#") sign.

			CREATE TABLE #LocalTemp
			(
 				UserID int,
 				Name varchar(50), 
 				Address varchar(150)
			)
			GO
			insert into #LocalTemp values ( 1, 'Shailendra','Noida');
			GO
			Select * from #LocalTemp

		The scope of Local temp table exist to the current session of current user means to the current query window. If you will close the current query window or open a new query window and will try to find above created temp table, it will give you the error.

		Global Temp Table
			Global temp tables are available to all SQL Server sessions or connections (means all the user). 
			Global temporary table name is stared with double hash ("##") sign.

			CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTemp(...)

	Table Variable

		user define function(imp): Table variables are the only way you can use DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on temporary data within a user-defined function			

		This acts like a variable and exists for a particular batch of query execution
		it gets dropped once it comes out of batch. 

		 GO
 		DECLARE @TProduct TABLE
 		(
		 SNo INT IDENTITY(1,1),
		 ProductID INT,
		 Qty INT
 		) 
 		--Insert data to Table variable @Product 
 		INSERT INTO @TProduct(ProductID,Qty)
 		SELECT DISTINCT ProductID, Qty FROM ProductsSales ORDER BY ProductID ASC 
		 --Select data
		 Select * from @TProduct
 
 		--Next batch
 		GO
 		Select * from @TProduct --gives error in next batch


--difference between static class and sealed class
	Sealed classes: 
	1)Can create instances, but cannot inherit
	2)Can contain static as well as nonstatic members.
 
	Static classes:
	1)Can neither create their instances, nor inherit them
	2)Can have static members only.

can abstract class be static c#
static class cannot be marked as abstract, because it would be pointless. abstract class makes sense 
when you want all derived classes to implement same part of the logic. 
But because static class cannot be derived there is no way other class will implement these gaps.

Equality in JavaScript: === versus ==
	--http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/does-it-matter-which-equals-operator-vs-i-use-in-javascript-comparisons
	
	The == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. 
	The === operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. 
	It's this case where === will be faster, and may return a different result than ==. In all other cases performance will be the same.
