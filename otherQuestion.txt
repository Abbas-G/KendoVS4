Equality in JavaScript: === versus ==
	--http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/does-it-matter-which-equals-operator-vs-i-use-in-javascript-comparisons
	
	The == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. 
	The === operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. 
	It's this case where === will be faster, and may return a different result than ==. In all other cases performance will be the same.
