SQLServer:
	dirty reads
		http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=721
		Quite often in database processing, we come across the situation wherein one transaction can change a value, and a second transaction can 			read this value before the original change has been committed or rolled back
		
		NOLOCK
			http://www.techrepublic.com/article/using-nolock-and-readpast-table-hints-in-sql-server/
			also known as READUNCOMMITTED, is applicable to SELECT statements only. NOLOCK indicates that no shared locks are issued against the 				table that would prohibit other transactions from modifying the data in the table.

		READPAST

	nocount
		what is its use : 
		SET NOCOUNT ON.  This one line of code, put at the top of a stored procedure turns off the messages that SQL Server sends back 			to the client after each T-SQL statement is executed.  This is performed for all SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Having		this information is handy when you run a T-SQL statement in a query window, but when stored procedures are run there is no need for this		information to be passed back to the client.

Equality in JavaScript: === versus ==
	--http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/does-it-matter-which-equals-operator-vs-i-use-in-javascript-comparisons
	
	The == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. 
	The === operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. 
	It's this case where === will be faster, and may return a different result than ==. In all other cases performance will be the same.
