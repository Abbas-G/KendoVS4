--diff http post and http get
	http get
		Data is visible to the user as it posts as query string.
		It is not secure but fast and quick.
		It use Stack method for passing form variable.
		Data is limited to max length of query string.
		It is good when you want user to bookmark page.
	http post
		Data is submitted in http request body.
		Data is not visible in the url.
		It is more secured but slower as compared to GET.
		It use heap method for passing form variable
		It can post unlimited form variables.
		It is advisable for sending critical data which should not visible to users.

--webform vs mvc
	http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/528117/WebForms-vs-MVC
	
	difference between ASP.NET (stateful) and ASP.NET-MVC (stateless) can be isolated 
	to the fact that the first provides server-side controls and the other do not.

	Bandwidth is more as client side state management options like Cookies, QueryStrings (URL), Hidden fields,
	View State and Control state involve in each roundtrip(as value posted to server)

	Web Forms supports Rich server controls.
	ASP.NET server control detects the browser and generates appropriate html and if required JavaScript also
	Rapid application development

	http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11155/Abstract-Class-versus-Interface
	http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6118/All-about-abstract-classes

	abstract class can not be sealed class
	abstract method cannot be private.
	Abstract and Interfaces can’t be instantiated directly.
	
	A class can implement any number of interfaces but a subclass can at most use only one abstract class.
	An abstract class can have non-abstract Methods(concrete methods) while in case of Interface all the methods has to be abstract.
	An abstract class can declare or use any variables while an interface is not allowed to do so.
	An abstract class can have constructor 
	all the members of interface are implicitly public.

	abstract class Can provide default behavior
		public abstract class Employee
			{
			public virutal String CalculateSalary()
				{
					//Can provide default behavior
				}
			}

--overriding and overloading
	http://www.aspdotnet-suresh.com/2013/09/c-sharp-overloading-and-overriding-differences-with-example.html
	
	-  Overloading (Called as Early Binding or Compile Time Polymorphism or static binding)
       	-  Overriding (Called as Late Binding or Run Time Polymorphism or dynamic binding)
       		We can override a method in base class by creating similar function in derived class
       		this can be achieved by using inheritance principle and using “virtual & override” keywords.
	
	-Overriding (eg)
		class Base {
   			public virtual void Test() { ... }
		}
		class Subclass1 : Base {
   			public override void Test() { ... }
		}

--readonly vs constant vs static 
	http://www.dotnet-tricks.com/Tutorial/csharp/FU4N141113-Difference-Between-Constant-and-ReadOnly-and-Static.html
	
	Constant and ReadOnly keyword are used to make a field constant which value cannot be modified.
	static can be modified
	
	Constant value must be assigned at the time of declaration (compile time)
	Readonly value can be initialized either at the time of declaration or with in the constructor of same class (runtime)
	
	static 
		static data member
			A static member belongs to the class rather than to the objects of the class.
			You can't use this keyword with static
		static constructor
			Static constructor can't be parameterized
			Static Constructor is used to initialize static data members of the class.
		Static Properties
			Static properties are used to get or set the value of static data members of a class.
		static method
			Static methods only use static data members to perform calculation or processing.
			called with the class name 

--c# get set properties
	Properties are a way to control access to your private members
	Properties have many uses: they can validate data before allowing a change;
	 they can transparently expose data on a class where that data is actually retrieved from some other source, 
	such as a database; they can take an action when data is changed, such as raising an event, 
	or changing the value of other fields.

Types of trigger
	--After Triggers (For Triggers)
		
		CREATE TRIGGER trgAfterInsert ON [dbo].[Employee_Test]

--What are attributes and filters in mvc

	http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/577776/Filters-and-Attributes-in-ASPNET-MVC
	
	MVC provides a very clean way of injecting the pre-processing and post-processing logic for actions and controllers.
	They way we can put the pre-processing and post-processing logic is by decorating the actions with attributes
	which will invoke an attribute class implementing the filter's logic.

	types of filter
		Authorization filter
		Action filter
		Result filter
		Exception filter

	Configuring Filters

		Global level
			protected void Application_Start()
			{
 			FilterConfig.RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilters.Filters);
			}
		Controller level
			[Authorize(Roles="Admin")]
			public class AdminController : Controller

		Action level
			[Authorize(Users="User1,User2")]
 			public ActionResult LinkLogin(string provider)


--Diff betwn Html.Action() or Html.RenderAction()
	The difference between the two is that 
	Html.RenderAction will render the result directly to the Response
	(which is more efficient if the action returns a large amount of HTML) 
	whereas Html.Action returns a string with the result.
	This method result can be stored in a variable, since it returns string type value.

--Diff betwn Html.Partial() or Html.RenderPartial()
	same for partial
	
	eg
	public static MvcHtmlString Partial(this HtmlHelper htmlHelper, string partialViewName, object model, ViewDataDictionary viewData)
	{
    	return mvcHtmlString; //encoded string
	}

	public static void RenderPartial(this HtmlHelper htmlHelper, string partialViewName)
	{
    	htmlHelper.RenderPartialInternal(partialViewName, htmlHelper.ViewData, null, htmlHelper.ViewContext.Writer, ViewEngines.Engines);
	}
	
--Partial And Action
	Partial :Simple to use and no need to create any child action.
		Html.Partial("_Comments")
	action: we need to create a child action for the rendering the partial view.
		@{Html.Action("Category","Home");} 

	renderPartial and renderAction
		here result will directly written to the HTTP response stream 
	
	Partial and Action
		here result can be stored in a variable, since it returns string type value.

--cast vs conversion vs parse
	Casting: Telling the compiler that an object is really something else without changing it (though some data loss may be incurred).

		object obj_s= "12345";
		string str_i = (string) obj; // "12345" as string, explicit

	Parsing: Telling the program to interpret (on runtime) a string.

		string int_s = "12345";
		int i = int.Parse(int_s); // 12345 as int

	Converting: Telling the program to use built in methods to try to change type for what may be not simply interchangeable.


--git vs svn
	http://mrbool.com/differences-between-git-and-svn/30636
	http://agile.dzone.com/articles/version-control-git-vs-svn
	https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSvnComparsion

	svn
		SVN has one central repository,

		SVN if the central repository goes down or the code has broken the build 
		then no other developers can commit there code until the repository is fixed.
		
		SVN if your working without an internet connection 
		you have lost all the features of version control. 

	git
		GIT has multiple repositories,
		one central repository but each developer has their own repository.		

		benefit of having a local repository is that it is quick,
		there is no network traffic needed to commit code into source control

		Git's repository and working directory sizes are extremely small when compared to SVN.

--session state management in .net 

--Client side State management
	cookies

--Server Side State management:  http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/freelance91/ASPNETstatemanagementtechniques01012007212655PM/ASPNETstatemanagementtechniques.aspx
	Application object
		Application object is used to store data which is visible 
		across entire application and shared across multiple user sessions
		like connection strung
	
	Session object:

		--Session state can be configured using the <session State> section in the application's web.config file. 
		--<sessionState mode = <"inproc" | "sqlserver" | "stateserver">
 		   cookieless = <"true" | "false">  
		--Default session timeout value is 20 
	

	In-Proc.
		In-Proc session handling then all the session information will be stored in the server memory.(w3wp.exe which is is a ISS Application Pool Process/worker process ) 
		This is the default session state in ASP.NET.
	
	StateServer.
 		session data will be stored in a separate computer(server) and the session data will be handled by a windows service.
	
	SQLServer.
		session data will be stored in the SqlServer.
		The benefit of having this scenario is that the data is stored in a centralized database rather than the server memory.
	
--Asp.Net Web API VS Asp.Net MVC
	http://www.dotnet-tricks.com/Tutorial/webapi/Y95G050413-Difference-between-ASP.NET-MVC-and-ASP.NET-Web-API.html

	but Asp.Net Web API is used to create full blown HTTP services with easy and simple way that returns only data not view.

	Web API helps to build REST-ful services
