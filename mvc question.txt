	Connstant and ReadOnly keyword are used to make a field constant which value cannot be modified.
	static can be modified
	
	Constant value must be assigned at the time of declaration (compile time)
	Readonly value can be initialized either at the time of declaration or with in the constructor of same class (runtime)

--c# get set properties
	Properties are a way to control access to your private members
	Properties have many uses: they can validate data before allowing a change;
	 they can transparently expose data on a class where that data is actually retrieved from some other source, 
	such as a database; they can take an action when data is changed, such as raising an event, 
	or changing the value of other fields.

--Difference between cast convert and parse

	Casting is when you take a variable of one type and change it to a different type. You can only do that in some cases, like so:

	string str = "Hello";
	object o = str;
	string str2 = (string)o;  // <-- This is casting  like (lisItem)viewbag,listItem
	Casting does not change the variable's value - the value remains of the same type (the string "Hello").

	Converting is when you take a value from one type and convert it to a different type:

	 double d = 5.5;
	 int i = (int)d;    // <---- d was converted to an integer like convert.toint32(string)
	Note that in this case, the conversion was done in the form of casting.

	Parsing is taking a string and converting it to a different type by understanding its content. For instance, 
	converting the string "123" to the number 123, or the string "Saturday, September 22nd" to a DateTime.
