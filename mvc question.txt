--c# get set properties
	Properties are a way to control access to your private members
	Properties have many uses: they can validate data before allowing a change;
	 they can transparently expose data on a class where that data is actually retrieved from some other source, 
	such as a database; they can take an action when data is changed, such as raising an event, 
	or changing the value of other fields.

Types of trigger
	--After Triggers (For Triggers)
		
		CREATE TRIGGER trgAfterInsert ON [dbo].[Employee_Test] 
		FOR INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
		AS
		begin
		end
	
	--Instead of trigger
		CREATE TRIGGER trgAfterInsert ON [dbo].[Employee_Test] 
		insted of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
		AS
		begin
			if(sal>100)
				rollback;
			else
				commmit;
		end
